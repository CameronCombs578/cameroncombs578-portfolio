        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="apple-webpage-modification.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>I "Vandalized" the official Apple website</h2>
        <p>
            I edited the text for main header of the official apple website from "iPhone 17 Pro" to "Hello!!!!". I modified the font size, line-height, font-weight, letter-spacing, and font family to create a large, spaced-out header with a math font. These changes made the website amusing because of the large text and funny phrase. I chose these specific changes because they give the site a less serious look. Thanks to this assignment, I understand how CSS and HTML worked together to create changes to my chosen website. Also, I have a better understanding of how to use dev tools to help me with my own webpages.
