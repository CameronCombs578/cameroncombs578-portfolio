                <p>My name is Cameron Combs. I was born in Canada and currently live in Texas. My major is computing applications, and I am a second-time college student at Texas Tech University. Thanks to my time taking multiple college classes, I have been educated on various fields. I hope to use this exposure to better serve others.</p>
