            Chosen webpage link: https://flexboxfroggy.com/  
        </p>
 
<p>
In my first screenshot, the specific element on my chosen website that uses the CSS Box Module is the first paragraph of the first level. This element’s margin is set to 0, and its padding-bottom is set to 1em, allowing the header to be easily read. If the padding for this element were to decrease, the space between this text and the list of text below it would decrease as well. This would create difficulty for users to read the paragraphs. 
</p>

<p>
In the second screenshot, the fifteenth level for the site contains a group of frogs and lily pads that are affected by Flexbox. Currently, the pond's flex-direction is set to row, which allows its users to use the order property to complete the puzzle. However, if the flex-direction for the pond element were to change from row to row-reverse, the users would have greater difficulties solving a puzzle where everything is reversed.

<p>
The Flexbox Froggy website is a simple site that displays the impacts that CSS Box Module and Flexbox can have on HTML code. Also, it demonstrates that even the simplest website contains important concepts.
