            Week 01 Student Introductions & The Purpose of a Personal Site – Cameron Combs 
        </p>

        <p>
            Part 01: I'd like to get to know you a bit and, perhaps more importantly, for you to get to know each other. Please introduce yourselves using this discussion.

Hi, my name is Cameron Combs. I was born in Canada and currently live in Texas. My major is computing applications, and I am a second-time college student. I have improved many of my skills thanks to my time in college, such as my writing, coding, communication, and reading skills. I have an interest in creating video games on computers and spending time with my family. My posted picture is of an early church writing. Writings such as this one contain the views that early Christians had on diverse topics. These writings reveal an important aspect of me because they have changed my perspectives, values, and priorities in life. One fun fact about me is that I have nine siblings. Thanks to their love and kindness, I almost never feel lonely, undervalued, or forgotten. Another fun fact is that I own chickens, and my task is to collect their eggs.

Part 02: After reviewing this week's (Week 01) content, please reflect on the following questions in at least 150 words.

The value of creating and maintaining my own personal website would be enabling me to add engagement to the World Wide Web. Currently, popular sites such as social media have been capturing the attention of viewers instead of developing a personal site on the web. A decrease in webpages would lead to less engaging internet. These thoughts of mine are discussed in one of our assigned readings: “A Handmaid Web – Carpenter.” It states, “I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies,” Carpenter, J. R. (2015) which shows that creating a personal website encourages and keeps the active participation of websites’ development. The benefits of learning HTML and CSS and then handcrafting individual webpages and full websites include being less reliant on other pages, effectively sharing information in a professional manner, and being more appreciative of the time that others used to created webpages. All these benefits allow users to recognize and fulfil the purpose of the internet, which is to connect people together using webpages.
