            Week 07 Discussion 03: The Living Web - Cameron Combs         </p>

 
<p>
I originally thought that Laurel Schwulst's essay "My website is a shifting house..." exaggerated the possibilities of websites. However, throughout my time completing assignments for this course, my eyes have been opened to three main concepts: a site is made up of multiple files, personal websites contribute to the Web, and there are endless possibilities for sites. This course has focused on continuously adding files to my portfolio, which makes my portfolio meet a website’s definition. Also, by creating a personal site, I have contributed to the Web’s cause and have seen the endless possibilities that sites can hold. These three concepts came to mind after looking over Laurel Schwulst’s essay again. </p>

The purpose of the website that I will build for Project 02: Final Project – Professional Portfolio will be to showcase my experience, skills, and knowledge in a well-structured and visually appealing format. Its audience will be people who are interested in knowing the skills that I have developed, and it will include concepts such as Flex Box and Hover Transitions. Although the specifics may change during the development process, this is my vision for my website. </p>
